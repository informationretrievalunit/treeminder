# how to use?
- just open build/index.html in your favorite browser (and hopefully it won't mess up with the visuals)
- you can delete things other than the build folder, since the rest are meant for developers, and you can change name of the build folder if you need too
- to show a local resource with relative path, put it in the same folder as index.html and use ./fileNameHere.fileExtensionHere
- saved maps get downloaded by your browser, so you can check where they are usually downloaded when you want to open one
